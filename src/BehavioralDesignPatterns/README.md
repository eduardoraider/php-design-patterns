# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## [Chain of Responsibility](./ChainOfResponsibility/README.md)

Lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process 
the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. [Learn more](./ChainOfResponsibility/README.md)

## [Command](./Command/README.md)

Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations. [Learn more](./Command/README.md)
