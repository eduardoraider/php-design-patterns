# Iterator

Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that allows sequential traversal through a complex data structure without exposing its internal details.

Thanks to the Iterator, clients can go over elements of different collections in a similar fashion using a single iterator interface.

**Usage examples:** The pattern is very common in PHP code. Many frameworks and libraries use it to provide a standard way for traversing their collections.

PHP has a built-in Iterator interface that can be used for building custom iterators compatible with the rest of the PHP code.

**Identification:** Iterator is easy to recognize by the navigation methods (such as next, previous and others). Client code that uses iterators might not have direct access to the collection being traversed.

## Real World Example
Since PHP already has a built-in Iterator interface, which provides convenient integration with foreach loops, itâ€™s very easy to create your own iterators for traversing almost every imaginable data structure.

This example of the Iterator pattern provides easy access to CSV files.

## Getting Started

1. **Build Docker Image**

   If not done already, build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t php-design-patterns-image .
   ```

2. **Run Docker Container**

   Run the Docker container using the built image. You have two options:
    - Run the container, navigate to the pattern directory, and interact manually:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app --name php-design-patterns-container php-design-patterns-image /bin/bash
   ```
   ```bash
   cd src/BehavioralDesignPatterns/Iterator
   ```

    - Run the container and directly enter the pattern directory:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app --name php-design-patterns-container php-design-patterns-image /bin/bash -c "cd src/BehavioralDesignPatterns/Iterator && /bin/bash"
   ```

3. **Execute via Command Line**

   Launch the example via Docker using the PHP executable:

   ```bash
   php index.php
   ```

4. **Output on Terminal**

   ```bash
    Array
    (
        [0] => Name
        [1] => Age
        [2] => Owner
        [3] => Breed
        [4] => Image
        [5] => Color
        [6] => Texture
        [7] => Fur
        [8] => Size
    )
      
    Array
    (
        [0] => Steve
        [1] => 3
        [2] => Alexander Shvets
        [3] => Bengal
        [4] => /cats/bengal.jpg
        [5] => Brown
        [6] => Stripes
        [7] => Short
        [8] => Medium
    )
      
    Array
    (
        [0] => Siri
        [1] => 2
        [2] => Alexander Shvets
        [3] => Domestic short-haired
        [4] => /cats/domestic-sh.jpg
        [5] => Black
        [6] => Solid
        [7] => Medium
        [8] => Medium
    )
      
    Array
    (
        [0] => Fluffy
        [1] => 5
        [2] => John Smith
        [3] => Maine Coon
        [4] => /cats/Maine-Coon.jpg
        [5] => Gray
        [6] => Stripes
        [7] => Long
        [8] => Large
    )
   ```
